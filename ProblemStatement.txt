Business Need:  
We want to provide a warm welcome to every new candidate who applies to our company. Currently, the process is manual and time-consuming, leading to delays in communication and a less-than-ideal candidate experience. We need to automate the sending of personalized welcome emails to candidates as soon as they submit their application through the Recruitment App. 


Functional Requirements: 
1. Trigger: The welcome email should be sent automatically whenever a new 'Candidate' record is created in Salesforce. 

2. Email Content: 
* The email should include a personalized greeting addressing the candidate by their name. 
* Provide a brief overview of the company, its culture, and values. 
* Outline the next steps in the recruitment process, including any upcoming assessments or interviews. 
* Express appreciation for the candidate's interest in the company. 

1. Email Template: 
* Create a visually appealing and professional email template that aligns with the company's branding. 
* Use merge fields to dynamically populate the candidate's name and other relevant information. 
   Technical Requirements: 
 
Apex Trigger: 
* Develop an Apex trigger on the 'Candidate' object to capture new record creation events.  Implement trigger logic to send the welcome email using a separate Apex handler class. 
* Adhere to Cloudkaptan Coding Standards, including: 
* Clear and descriptive trigger and handler class names. 
* Bulkification to handle potential bulk Candidate creation scenarios. 
* Error handling using try-catch blocks to gracefully manage exceptions. 
* Thorough unit testing with at least 90% code coverage. 


Email Template: 
* Design an email template that meets the content and branding requirements. 

Test Class : 
Write the Test class for unit testing and scenario testing , while following the test class guidelines from the Cloudkaptan Standards and Coding Guidelines.   

Additional Considerations: 
* Email Deliverability: Ensure the email template and sending mechanism are optimized for deliverability and can be tracked via email log. 
* Write a Apex Trigger (Quick Glimpse of Standards)
* Keep trigger logic minimal and delegate complex logic to a trigger handler class. 
* Use a trigger framework to manage trigger execution and avoid recursion. 
* Also keep in mind the guidelines for the ExtendedTriggerHandler 
* Ensure the trigger is bulkified to handle multiple records efficiently. 
* Write test classes to cover various trigger scenarios and ensure proper functionality.
